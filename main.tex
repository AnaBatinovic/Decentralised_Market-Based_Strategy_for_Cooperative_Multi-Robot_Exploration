\begin{abstract}

This work presents a novel approach to autonomous decentralised multi-robot frontier exploration and mapping of an unknown area based on the market model. The exploration algorithm enables mobile robots to communicate among each other, to negotiate and to become dispersed throughout the environment. The mobile robot team simultaneously explores the environment, discovers frontier points (points on the border between the explored and unexplored space), and negotiates by fully connected graph and event-based communication. During the negotiation process, the amount of information exchanged between the robots is limited to data about the frontier points. The main goal is to allocate the mobile robots to target frontier points in the environment in a way which minimises the overall exploration time. The proposed strategy has been implemented in a simulation environment and compared with a centralised strategy. The simulation results demonstrate improved behaviour of the decentralised multi-robot strategy in terms of total exploration time and path length.

\section{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK}
We have presented an approach to autonomous decentralised multi-robot exploration and mapping based on the market model. This strategy has demonstrated improved behaviour compared to the centralised strategy that explicitly coordinates the robots, based on estimates of expected information gain and the cost of exploration. This includes both reduced total exploration time and path length per robot.

However, the approach described in this paper is limited in two aspects. First, in this work the filter module reduces the number of the frontier points by removing the points that are too close to each other. We are investigating improved frontier point filtering and clustering, which we believe will improve overall performance significantly. And second, all mobile robots communicate to each other and create a fully connected graph. If the communication range is limited and it is assumed that just the mobile robots close to each other can communicate and negotiate, coordinated exploration can still be performed, trading off quality of coordination for smaller required communication bandwidth.
